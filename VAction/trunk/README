VAction - VG Software 2005

VAction is a web application framework that looks very much like a striped down
version of Struts (http://struts.apache.org/). Struts was the insperation 
during the development of this framework.
To compile and run this you need commons collections and commons dbcp 
(http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/).
